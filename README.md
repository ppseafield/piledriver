# Storybook

Note that, at the time of setup, `nuxi add module storybook` added some old versions, and `@nuxtjs/storybook` is version 8.3.3, where the current `@storybook` version is 8.6.12.

I've added the most recent version of every package, but the nuxt module that loads storybook with the nuxt dev server crashes when storybook is enabled. You can simply run `pnpm run storybook` instead to get a running storybook server.
